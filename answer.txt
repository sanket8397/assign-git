2. What does fast-forward in git mean?
Ans :
When you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit’s history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together – this is called a “fast-forward.”

3. Why should you have different branches?
Ans :
Git branches come in handy at a variety of points during the development of a project. Branches create a separate line of development from the main master branch. There are numerous benefits to doing so. Consider the following scenario: you are working on a project with your team and have completed a feature. You contact the client to request that they view the feature, but they are too busy, so you send them the project link.

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 
Ans :
Usually there is only 1 repository in a project. If you are working on a big project, then it is inevitable that you need to work with multiple repositories.
